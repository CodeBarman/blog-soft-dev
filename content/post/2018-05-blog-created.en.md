Today is May 31, 2018 and I finally came up writing my personal blog. First content doesn't suppose to be interesting from the beginning but I promise it will become better and better each day :)

Firstly, I would like to say that there are multiple reasons why I decided to start a blog but the most important for me two following reasons:

- First, writing posts can help me to improve my writing skills and help to be up-to-date with new technologies;
- Second, posts will help me to memorize interesting things about technologies I am not using very often, but still want to remember how to use them.

### My requirements to blog engine:

- I should be able to work online and offline;
- All my blog's content should version controlled;
- I don't want to use HTML to write a post;
- I should be able to use different themes and be able to customize any of them I choose;
- It should not take much time to learn blog engine and all gained skills should be applicable in other areas;
- It should generate static pages and be able to work without a database;
- I should be able to write content on multiple languages, english, russian and potentially italian as well;
- Blog's pages should be SEO friendly;
- There should be a way to add CMS if I need to.

Yeah, I think that's it. After some research I found [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a good choice for me because it meets all my requirements. It uses modern technologies, and it is very easy to learn with a good amount of documentation, also it runs incredibly fast, because it generates static pages.



### What to expect from this blog?

- I will try to write pages ate least once a week;
- I will try to translate the page on english and russian at least;
- I will add new pages and customize the blog as I go further with content;
- Once I will add ten posts I will consider buying a custom domain.

BTW, how do you like the name "Code Esthete"? Please leave your comment under the post.

And I think it is enough for the first post. If you have any suggestions please feel free to reach me via Contact me page.
